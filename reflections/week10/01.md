## Questions

1. What are the three categories of data types? How are they different?
- Value, reference, and  pointer. A value type is a data type that stores the value of the data. A reference type stores the address of a value, If that value changes the reference does not, but the value a reference gives does. A pointer "points" to an address, but has much stricter rules than a reference in that if cannot point to a reference.

2. What are the Value-type data types? What differences do you notice from JavaScript?
- That there are many more, likely because cSharp has much stricter rules on how data types can be defined, and how large they can be.

3. In your own words how do Reference types get stored in memory? How does this differ from Value types?
- A reference type stores the location in memory of a value type, not the data itself.
