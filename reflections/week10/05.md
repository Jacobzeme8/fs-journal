# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?

- SQL and postman were definitly a struggle this week. As much as SQL makes sense trying to find what errores out when something goes wrong can be a pain. As well as with postman, trying to find out exaclty what a test wants can be quite frustrating. Although I have picked up on CSharp quite well.
