## Questions

1. What is a List in C#?
- a list is very similer to an array in JS. It stores multiple values in one area, using an index to reference one data. ALthough a list can only store one data type.

2. What List methods seem like you might use them often? Why?
List.containes, list.add, list.addrange, list.exists, list.find, list.findall, list.findindex. They are all very similer to what weve using in JS arrays

3. How would you retrieve an item from a list? What method could you use?
- it depends on what information you have on the item. Assuming the item has a unique identifier it would use list.find.
