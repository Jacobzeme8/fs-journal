## Questions

1. What are the three states of a `Promise`?
- pending, resolved, and Rejected
2. How do `promise`s seek to resolve the issues of "callback hell"?
- you can use callbacks through promises by chainging them, basically keeping the promises in one function or method rather than nesting them and using async to make them wait for themselves to finish before callling the next line.
3. What is the difference between `.then()` and `.catch()`?
- the .then methon is called when a promise is fufilled, the .catch is called when a promise is rejected.
