# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?

- things went very well this week, i was confidendt with my fullstack app as well as knowing what to google when i needed it( such as the input of a min on a datetime-local ). I did learn that accesability is a big thing and that i should focus more on it. I also still need to get better at design, but i would say my functionality is going very well.
