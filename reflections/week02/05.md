# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?

- learning the principles of java script went quite well, It seems like they are somewhat difficult concepts to grasp but once you do it becomes quite easy as you just have to go through the logic.

- the biggest thing i would have to work on is code readability, as I can write something that works, but how well it can be read is another story.
