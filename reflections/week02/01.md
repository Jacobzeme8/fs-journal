## Questions

1. What is Scope ?
- scope is the area in which a variable is present. Such as a variable defined in a function cannot be used outside the function, but a variable defined outside the function can be used in a fucntion
2. What is Hoisting ?
- hoisting is moving a variable into a different, higher, scope. Such as if you want to use a variable inside a funcion in a different function you might hoist that globally so that you can use it in both.
3. In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?
- var is not terribly useful anymore, while const you would use when defining a variable that you do not want to be able to be reasigned. let will asign variables that can have their values changed, such as the price of something on a week to week basis
