## Questions

1. What are the three ways to syntactically write a function? What are the differences in how the function acts (if any)?
- function name(parameters), let name = function(param), let name = (param) =>. the first, a function declaration creats a name for the function an hoists it. the second makes a function with no name and that is not hoiseted. the last, arrow function, does not create its own "this " value

2. What is the difference between Parameters and Arguments?
- a parameter is what is put in the function () when created, and then used within the function as a place holder. an argument is what is put in the () when the function is called, and fills those placeholder variables within the function

3. What are higher order functions? Can you provide an example?
- higher order functions are essentially nested functions. Functions that rely on one another for their own function, or parameters.
