# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?

- this week has definitly been daunting but i am grasping and using the concepts, vue works very well but it is alot of repetitiveness and knowhow.
- the thing im most struggling with is manipulating data outside a component and putting that in, such as I want this part of the component to display on this page, but maybe not this part
- I have gotten injecting componets and navagating pages down fairly well and i am happy with that
