## Questions

1. What is the difference between a `primary key` and a `foreign key`
- a primary key is used as a unique identifyer to a row in a table, a foreign key allows rows in one table to be linked to rows in anothr table

2. What is an `Alias`?
- Aliases are used to make columns or properties on the fly as needed when joining tables with relationships

3. Demonstrate how you would query a join statement that would get all of a doctors patients from the following collections:

```SQL
CREATE TABLE doctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE patients (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE doctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  doctorId INT NOT NULL,
  patientId INT NOT NULL,

  FOREIGN KEY (doctorId)
    REFERENCES doctors(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (patientId)
    REFERENCES patients(id),
)

```

- SELECT doctors.*, patients.* FROM doctors JOIN patients ON doctores.patientId == patient.id
