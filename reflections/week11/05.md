# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?

- Everything went quite well, even after getting frustrated with sql and errors. I did make a reactive search bar which was quite nice. I would't say im struggling with too much, my biggest issue is timeboxing and not because i dont timebox, but because im very bullheaded when it comes to a problem that needs fixing
