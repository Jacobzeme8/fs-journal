## Questions

Write a review and reflection of your experiences in this course, as this is the last lecture before your `final project`, what are your concerns, how do you plan to manage your time, what have you enjoyed most about the course up to this point.
- My biggest concern is making the UI adhere the the codeworks standards. IT is alot of going back through and making sure everything has a tiltle, tags are in the correct spot, visually it is up to standards, etc.
