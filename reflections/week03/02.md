## Questions

1. What is the purpose of Encapsulation?
- it is essentially keeping data in one place and using references for that data in other areas. You would not want to directly modify the data rather using a class,function, method, etc somewhere else to modify that data through a reference of that data.
2. What were some of the problems with closures and the underscore prefix?
- One is that some developers do not reconize what the underscore means(private function). The other is that it is seen as modifiable without the users knowing, creating a clash of what the user thinks is happening and what the devoloper intended
3. How do we create private variables in a ES6 Class? Why would you do this?
- you would use the # key when defining the variable, as well as when it is called. It keeps a true privacy using encapsualtion in classes, as well as it does not require naming convention as with the underscore

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment
- How to correclty link up js pages as well as starting to organize them in a way that makes sense. Ie services for modifying data, model for just defining what the object/properties of such would look like, and controller for interacting with the DOM.
