# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?

- Ive definitly got a good grasp on how js files/classes link up with eachother, and why they should.
- how much information can be stored in the model as long as it specifially pertianes to that object
- Not a huge struggle but one thing is correctly identifying what should or shouldnt be a hidden funciton in an object, as well as what might belong in services compared to a controller. Such as defining an active item in the controller instead of writing one line of code in the service to handle it. It almost seems a little too strict to do that
- Getting a better understanding of what the utitlites given to us exaclty do. I know more than gas pedal means go in a car, but not enough to take it apart and put it back together. But i do know that there are gears, pistons, generally how they fit together, etc.
