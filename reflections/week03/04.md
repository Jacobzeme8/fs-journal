> **ðŸ“– [The Observer Pattern](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk3/04-Observer-Pattern)**

## Questions

1. What problems does the Observer Pattern seek to solve?
- to call upon some function in real time when a value or property has been changed
2. What are the three mechanisms of the observer pattern?
- subscribe, unsubscribe and broadcast.
3. Review the code generated from the bcw-template and reflect on the proxy objects from yesterday, and your understanding of the observer pattern today. With this knowledge, explain how the magic of the bcw-template uses these two concepts to manage and update the dom.
- The utilites are essentially the proxy, the middle man between what we put in and what we want/expext to come out. If we put in a "key", or ID and some template or html into the setHTML, we expect it to set the html to that template, and if not report some sort of error. Meanwhile the eventemmiter.js is a form of oberver. We give it a key as to what it should be observing in the appstate, with the on function, and a function to be preformed, the assert. While the emit is the broadcaster for the on/oberver with the same key so that after the on has a subscriber, and an assertion as to what it is supposed to do, the emit or broadcast with the key broadcasts the key, the on sees that and asserts the function.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment
- That a model can have much more than just defining what a object should look like, such as a template or an array of information, as long as those templates or data will always specifically pertain to that object.
