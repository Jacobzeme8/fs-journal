## Questions

1. What problem does using exports solve?
- exports let different files talk to one another. This allows for much better organization as well as keeping logic and data hidden from the user that they do not need to know.
2. How does export differ from export default?
- using export default lets you export/import a defaults method, while export simply exports the whole class.
3. What is a benefit of using the Module System?
- they allow you to organize your code better as well as keeping the same function or method in two different moduals seperate from one another. Although it is still good practice to name them something slightly different to keep yourself oraganized.
