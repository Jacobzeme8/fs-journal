## Questions

1. What are the two common operations that we will set in the handler?
- the get operation, simply looking at data and returning it. As well as the set operations, "setting" or changing the value or property of an object
2. What do you have to make sure you are doing with every Get to ensure the value does not become `undefined`?
- The defualt operator of a get wants a return, if there is no return given it will return undefined on its own
3. What are some of the benefits of the proxy object that we are using in our structure for applications?
- being able to check what properties are being accessed in an object as well as providing information to the user/devoloper. The handler can also be reused in different proxys, creating less code duplication.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment
- That objects with different properties should have their own seperate MVCS, but all created in the app.js. As well as controllers should never talk to one another, there is too much of a potnetial and real issue of code getting crisscrossed.
