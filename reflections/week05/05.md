# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?

- I feel like i have a good understatind of what a virtual property is and how to use it, although knowing what the front end might need and creating that on the back end is definitly a challenge, as well as organzing a group to get things done and making sure we are organizing our own code for others to read
